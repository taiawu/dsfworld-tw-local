This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
source("../2_add_layouts/support_scripts/layout_handling.R")
source("../1_upload_raw/support_scripts/upload_formatters.R")
```

```{r}
# given a file path to the layout, make the layout dataframe
lo384 <- make_layout("sample_layout.csv") %>%
        add_standardized_wells()

data_raw <- read.csv("sample_data_file.csv")

by_well <- nest_raw(data_raw) %>%
           add_standardized_wells()

by_well_layout <- join_layout_nest(by_well, lo384) 
by_well_layout
```

```{r}
# # test the well translation function
# by_well_a1 <- by_well %>% mutate(well = c("a1", "a2", "a3"))
# by_well_A01 <- by_well %>% mutate(well = c("A01", "A02", "A03"))
# by_well_a01 <- by_well %>% mutate(well = c("a01", "a02", "a03"))
# 
# add_standardized_wells( by_well )
# add_standardized_wells( by_well_a1 )
# add_standardized_wells( by_well_A01 )
# add_standardized_wells( by_well_a01 )

# test the layouts 
# lo384E <- make_layout("sample_layout_empties.csv") # lets just keep the "empty" convention, since i don't know how different computers/excel versions deal with empty cells 
# lo96 <- make_layout("sample_layout_96.csv")
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
